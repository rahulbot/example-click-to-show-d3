# Things You Can Do ðŸš§

There are number of things you can do to try out your skills:

### Beginner

- Get rid of the white under the footer, perhaps by changing the body
  `background-color` attribute in CSS.
- Add yourselves as authors via more `meta` tags.

### Intermediate

- Move the `showText` function over the script.js to clean up the code.
- Add another langauge. You can use [lipsum.com](https://www.lipsum.com) to
  generate some text in other languages.

### Advanced

- Change the d3 code to use an animation to switch between the text that is showing.
  Hint: you could string together commands to that relate to creating a `transition` of
  the `opacity` style property.
